# INFO6150 Project 1
## *DUE NOVEMBER 7 BY 5PM PST*

Each student is assigned a screenshot from the /screenshots directory as follows:

* Cheng, Peter: austin-statesman.png 	 	 
* Hou, Tianyu: boston-globe.png
* Liu, Yue: chicago-tribune.png
* Qiu, Xiaohan: la-times.png
* Shi, Gordon: miami-herald.png
* Tong, Lulu: milwaukee-journal-sentinel.png
* Wei, Zhibo: new-york-times.png
* Bist, Sangita: washington-post.png

## The assignment

Similar to what we did in Week 6, please take your assigned screenshot of a newspaper website homepage and transform it into semantic HTML and CSS.

You will submit:
* a single HTML file named index.html. This HTML must demonstrate well-formed and semantic HTML.
* at least one CSS file named style.css.

You may create as many CSS files as you wish, but they all must be linked in your HTML files

For this assignment, you will be graded on how closely you recreate the
*layout* and *styling* of the screenshot.

Assume a maximum width of 1200px for your page, approximately the width
of the screenshot.

**Please be sure to complete this assignment to the best of your ability, as we will use it to build on for your final project.**

## Images

I have not provided any of the images shown in the screenshots. You are welcome
either to:
1. find your own images to use from Google Images (making sure they are the appropriate size to fit in your layout.)
2. Use an image placeholder service (a large list of which can be found here: https://loremipsum.io/21-of-the-best-placeholder-image-generators/)

Many of the newspapers use an image-based logo as the title; please just use
text for the title instead.

## Submitting your assignment

1. Save your index.html and styles.css in your individual assignment repo.
2. Commit your changes and push the repo as instructed by Github Classroom.
